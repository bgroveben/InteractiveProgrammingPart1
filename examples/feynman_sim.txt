On the program it says this is a keynote speech--and I don't know
what a keynote speech is. I do not intend in any way to suggest what should
be in this meeting as a keynote of the subjects or anything like that. I have
my own things to say and to talk about and there's no implication that
anybody needs to talk about the same thing or anything like it. So what I
want to talk about is what Mike Dertouzos suggested that nobody would
talk about. I want to talk about the problem of simulating physics with
computers and I mean that in a specific way which I am going to explain.
The reason for doing this is something that I learned about from Ed
Fredkin, and my entire interest in the subject has been inspired by him. It
has to do with learning something about the possibilities of computers, and
also something about possibilities in physics. If we suppose that we know all
the physical laws perfectly, of course we don't have to pay any attention to
computers. It's interesting anyway to entertain oneself wit
468 Feylaman
locality of interaction. I would not like to think of a very enormous
computer with arbitrary interconnections throughout the entire thing.
Now, what kind of physics are we going to imitate? First, I am going to
describe the possibility of simulating physics in the classical approximation,
a thing which is usuaUy described by local differential equations. But the
physical world is quantum mechanical, and therefore the proper problem is
the simulation of quantum physics--which is what I really want to talk
about, but I'U come to that later. So what kind of simulation do I mean?
There is, of course, a kind of approximate simulation in which you design
numerical algorithms for differential equations, and then use the computer
to compute these algorithms and get an approximate view of what physics
ought to do. That's an interesting subject, but is not what I want to talk
about. I want to talk about the possibility that there is to be an exact
simulation, that the computer will do exactly the same as nature. If this is to
be proved and the type of computer is as I've already explained, then it's
going to be necessary that everything that happens in a finite volume of
space and time would have to be exactly analyzable with a finite number of
logical operations. The present theory of physics is not that way, apparently.
It allows space to go down into infinitesimal distances, wavelengths to get
infinitely great, terms to be summed in infinite order, and so forth; and
therefore, if this proposition is right, physical law is wrong.
So good, we already have a suggestion of how we might modify
physical law, and that is the kind of reason why I like to study this sort of
problem. To take an example, we might change the idea that space is
continuous to the idea that space perhaps is a simple lattice and everything
is discrete (so that we can put it into a finite number of digits) and that time
jumps discontinuously. Now let's see what kind of a physical world it would
be or what kind of problem of computation we would have. For example,
the first difficulty that would come out is that the speed of light would
depend slightly on the direction, and there might be other anisotropies in
the physics that we could detect experimentally. They might be very small
anisotropies. Physical knowledge is of course always incomplete, and you
can always say we'll try to design something which beats experiment at the
present time, but which predicts anistropies on some scale to be found later.
That's fine. That would be good physics if you could predict something
consistent with all the known facts and suggest some new fact that we didn't
explain, but I have no specific examples. So I'm not objecting to the fact
that it's anistropic in principle, it's a question of how anistropic. If you tell
me it's so-and-so anistropic, I'll tell you about the experiment with the
lithium atom which shows that the anistropy is less than that much, and
that this here theory of yours is impossible.
Simulating Physics with Computers 469
Another thing that had been suggested early was that natural laws are
reversible, but that computer rules are not. But this turned out to be false;
the computer rules can be reversible, and it has been a very, very useful
thing to notice and to discover that. (Editors' note: see papers by Bennett,
Fredkin, and Toffoli, these Proceedings). This is a place where the relationship
of physics and computation has turned itself the other way and told us
something about the possibilities of computation. So this is an interesting
subject because it tells us something about computer rules, and might tell us
something about physics.
The rule of simulation that I would like to have is that the number of
computer elements required to simulate a large physical system is only to be
proportional to the space-time volume of the physical system. I don't want
to have an explosion. That is, if you say I want to explain this much physics,
I can do it exactly and I need a certain-sized computer. If doubling the
volume of space and time means I'll need an exponentially larger computer,
I consider that against the rules (I make up the rules, I'm allowed to do
that). Let's start with a few interesting questions.
2. SIMULATING TIME
First I'd like to talk about simulating time. We're going to assume it's
discrete. You know that we don't have infinite accuracy in physical measurements
so time might be discrete on a scale of less than 10 -27 sec. (You'd
have to have it at least like to this to avoid clashes with experiment--but
make it 10 -41 sec. if you like, and then you've got us!)
One way in which we simulate timewin cellular automata, for example
--is to say that "the computer goes from state to state." But really, that's
using intuition that involves the idea of time--you're going from state to
state. And therefore the time (by the way, like the space in the case of
cellular automata) is not simulated at all, it's imitated in the computer.
An interesting question comes up: "Is there a way of simulating it,
rather than imitating it?" Well, there's a way of looking at the world that is
called the space-time view, imagining that the points of space and time are
all laid out, so to speak, ahead of time. And then we could say that a
"computer" rule (now computer would be in quotes, because it's not the
standard kind of computer which cperates in time) is: We have a state s~ at
each point i in space-time. (See Figure 1.) The state s i at the space time
point i is a given function F,(sj, s k .... ) of the state at the points j, k in some
neighborhood of i:
s,= .... )
470 Feynman
• • s~
" ~i "
• " "$k
oto
~pac~
Fig. 1.
You'll notice immediately that if this particular function is such that the
value of the function at i only involves the few points behind in time, earlier
than this time i, all I've done is to redescrib6 the cellular automaton,
because it means that you calculate a given point from points at earlier
times, and I can compute the next one and so on, and I can go through this
in that particular order. But just let's us think of a more general kind of
computer, because we might have a more general function. So let's tlaink
about whether we could have a wider case of generality of interconnections
of points in space-time. If F depends on a//the points both in the future and
the past, what then? That could be the way physics works. I'll mention how
our theories go at the moment. It has turned out in many physical theories
that the mathematical equations are quite a bit simplified by imagining such
a thing--by imagining positrons as electrons going backwards in time, and
other things that connect objects forward and backward. The important
question would be, if this computer were laid out, is there in fact an
organized algorithm by which a solution could be laid out, that is, computed?
Suppose you know this function F, and it is a function of the
variables in the future as well. How would you lay out numbers so that they
automatically satisfy the above equation? It may not be possible. In the case
of the cellular automaton it is, because from a given row you get the next
row and then the next row, and there's an organized way of doing it. It's an
interesting question whether there are circumstances where you get functions
for which you can't think, at least right away, of an organized way of
laying it out. Maybe sort of shake it down from some approximation, or
something, but it's an interesting different type of computation.
Question: "Doesn't this reduce to the ordinary boundary value, as
opposed to initial-value type of calculation?"
Answer: "Yes, but remember this is the computer itself that I'm
describing."
It appears actually that classical physics is causal. You can, in terms of
the information in the past, if you include both momentum and position, or
Simulating Physics with Computers 471
the position at two different times in the past (either way, you need two
pieces of information at each point) calculate the future in principle. So
classical physics is local, causal, and reversible, and therefore apparently
quite adaptable (except for the discreteness and so on, which I already
mentioned) to computer simulation. We have no difficulty, in principle,
apparently, with that.
3. SIMULATING PROBABILITY
Turning to quantum mechanics, we know immediately that here we get
only the ability, apparently, to predict probabilities. Might I say immediately,
so that you know where I really intend to go, that we always have
had (secret, secret, close.the doors!) we always have had a great deal of
difficulty in understanding the world view that quantum mechanics represents.
At least I do, because I'm an old enough man that I haven't got to the
point that this stuff is obvious to me. Okay, I still get nervous with it. And
therefore, some of the younger students ... you know how it always is,
every new idea, it takes a generation or two until it becomes obvious that
there's no real problem. It has not yet become obvious to me that there's no
real problem. I cannot define the real problem, therefore I suspect there's no
real problem, but I'm note sure there's no real problem. So that's why I like
to investigate things. Can I learn anything from asking this question about
computers--about this may or may not be mystery as to what the world
view of quantum mechanics is? So I know that quantum mechanics seem to
involve probability--and I therefore want to talk about simulating probability.

Well, one way that we could have a computer that simulates a probabilistic
theory, something that has a probability in it, would be to calculate
the probability and then interpret this number to represent nature. For
example, let's suppose that a particle has a probability P(x, t) to be at x at a
time t. A typical example of such a probability might satisfy a differential
equation, as, for example, if the particle is diffusing:
al,(x, t) _ v P(x,t) Ot
Now we could discretize t and x and perhaps even the probability itself and
solve this differential equation like we solve any old field equation, and
make an algorithm for it, making it exact by discretization. First there'd be
a problem about discretizing probability. If you are only going to take k
digits it would mean that when the probability is less that 2 -k of something
happening, you say it doesn't happen at all. In pra
472 Feymman
probability of something is 10 -7°°, we say it isn't going to happen, and
we're not caught out very often. So we could allow ourselves to do that. But
the real difficulty is this: If we had many particles, we have R particles, for
example, in a system, then we would have to describe the probability of a
circumstance by giving the probability to find these particles at points
x l, x 2 ..... x R at the time t. That would be a description of the probability of
the system. And therefore, you'd need a k-digit number for every configuration
of the system, for every arrangement of the R values of x. And
therefore if there are N points in space, we'd need N n configurations.
Actually, from our point of view that at each point in space there is
information like electric fields and so on, R will be of the same order as N if
the number of information bits is the same as the number of points in space,
and therefore you'd have to have something like N u configurations to be
described to get the probability out, and that's too big for our computer to
hold if the size of the computer is of order N.
We emphasize, if a description of an isolated part of nature with N
variables requires a general function of N variables and if a computer
stimulates this by actually computing or storing this function then doubling
the size of nature (N--,2N) would require an exponentially explosive
growth in the size of the simulating computer. It is therefore impossible,
according to the rules stated, to simulate by calculating the probability_
Is there any other way? What kind of simulation can we have? We can't
expect to compute the probability of configurations for a probabilistic
theory. But the other way to simulate a probabilistic nature, which I'll call
% for the moment, might still be to simulate the probabilistic nature by a
computer C which itself is probabilistic, in which you always randomize the
last two digit's of every number, or you do something terrible to it. So it
becomes what I'll call a probabilistic computer, in which the output is n~at a
unique function of the input. And then you try to work it out so that it
simulates nature in this sense: that C goes from some state--initial state if
you like--to some final state with the same probability that % goes from
the corresponding initial state to the corresponding final state. Of course
when you set up the machine and let nature do it, the imitator will not do
the same thing, it only does it with the same probability. Is that no good?
No it's O.K. How do you know what the probability is? You see, nature's
unpredictable; how do you expect to predict it with a computer? You can't,
--it's unpredictable if it's probabilistic. But what you really do ila a
probabilistic system is repeat the experiment in nature a large number of
times. If you repeat the same experiment in the computer a large number of
times (and that doesn't take any more time than it does to do the same thing
in nature of course), it will give the frequency of a given final state
proportional to the number of times, with approximately the same rate (plus
Simulating Physics with Computers 473
or minus the square root of n and all that) as it happens in nature. In other
words, we could imagine and be perfectly happy, I think, with a probabilisfic
simulator of a probabilistic nature, in which the machine doesn't exactly
do what nature does, but if you repeated a particular type of experiment a
sufficient number of times to determine nature's probability, then you did
the corresponding experiment on the computer, you'd get the corresponding
probability with the corresponding accuracy (with the same kind of accuracy
of statistics).
So let us now think about the characteristics of a local probabilistic
computer, because I'll see if I can imitate nature with that (by "nature" I'm
now going to mean quantum mechanics). One of the characteristics is that
you can determine how it behaves in a local region by simply disregarding
what it's doing in all other regions. For example, suppose there are variables
in the system that describe the whole world (xA, xs)--ythe variables x A
you're interested in, they're "around here"; x s are the whole result of the
world. If you want to know the probability that something around here is
happening, you would have to get that by integrating the total probability of
all kinds of possibilities over x s. If we had computed this probability, we
would still have to do the integration
P (xA) = f e(x , xB)dxB
which is a hard job! But if we have imitated the probability, it's very simple
to do it: you don't have to do anything to do the integration, you simply
disregard what the values of x s are, you just look at the region x A. And
therefore it does have the characteristic of nature: if it's local, you can find
out what's happening in a region not by integrating or doing an extra
operation, but merely by disregarding what happens elsewhere, which is no
operation, nothing at all.
The other aspect that I want to emphasize is that the equations will
have a form, no doubt, something like the following. Let each point
i---1,2 .... ,N in space be in a state si chosen from a small state set (the size
of this set should be reasonable, say, up to 25). And let the probability to
find some configuration (s,} (a set of values of the state s i at each point i)
be some number P({si) ). It satisfies an equation such that at each jump in
time
(s'}
where m(si[s:, s~...) is the probability that we move to state s i at point i
474 Feynman
when the neighbors have values s~, s;, .... where j, k etc. are points in the
neighborhood of i. As j moves far from i, m becomes ever less sensitive to
s'j. At each change the state at a particular point i will move from what it
was to a state s with a probability m that depends only upon the states of
the neighborhood (which may be so defined as to include the point i itself).
This gives the probability of making a transition. It's the same as in a
cellular automaton; only, instead of its being definite, it's a probability. Tell
me the environment, and I'll tell you the probability after a next moment of
time that this point is at state s. And that's the way it's going to work, okay?
So you get a mathematical equation of this kind of form.
Now I explicitly go to the question of how we can simulate with a
computer--a universal automaton or something--the quantum-meclianJcal
effects. (The usual formulation is that quantum mechanics has some sort of
a differential equation for a function ~k.) If you have a single particle, q, is a
function of x and t, and this differential equation could be simulated just
like my probabilistic equation was before. That would be all right and one
has seen people make little computers which simulate the Schr6edinger
equation for a single particle. But the full description of quantum mechanics
for a large system with R particles is given by a function q~(x I, x 2 ..... x n, t)
which we call the amplitude to find the particles x I ..... xR, and therefore,
because it has too many variables, it cannot be simulated with a normal
computer with a number of elements proportional to R or proportional to
N. We had the same troubles with the probability in classical physics. And
therefore, the problem is, how can we simulate the quantum mechanics?
There are two ways that we can go about it. We can give up on our rule
about what the computer was, we can say: Let the computer itself be built
of quantum mechanical elements which obey quantum mechanical laws. Or
we can turn the other way and say: Let the computer still be the same kind
that we thought of before--a logical, universal automaton; can we imitate
this situation? And I'm going to separate my talk here, for it branches into
two parts.
4. QUANTUM COMPUTERS--UNIVERSAL QUANTUM
SIMULATORS
The first branch, one you might call a side-remark, is, Can you do it
with a new kind of computer--a quantum computer? (I'11 come back to the
other branch in a moment.) Now it turns out, as far as I can tell, that you
can simulate this with a quantum system, with quantum computer elemexats.
It's not a Turing machine, but a machine of a different kind. If we disregard
the continuity of space and make it discrete, and so on, as an approximation
(the same way as we allowed ourselves in the classical case), it does seem to
Simulating Physics with Computers 475
be true that all the various field theories have the same kind of behavior,
and can be simulated in every way, apparently, with little latticeworks of
spins and other things. It's been noted time and time again that the
phenomena of field theory (if the world is made in a discrete lattice) are well
imitated by many phenomena in solid state theory (which is simply the
analysis of a latticework of crystal atoms, and in the case of the kind of
solid state I mean each atom is just a point which has numbers associated
with it, with quantum-mechanical rules). For example, the spin waves in a
spin lattice imitating Bose-particles in the field theory. I therefore believe
it's true that with a suitable class of quantum machines you could imitate
any quantum system, including the physical world. But I don't know
whether the general theory of this intersimulation of quantum systems has
ever been worked out, and so I present that as another interesting problem:
to work out the classes of different kinds of quantum mechanical systems
which are really intersimulatable--which are equivalent--as has been done
in the case of classical computers. It has been found that there is a kind of
universal computer that can do anything, and it doesn't make much
difference specifically how it's designed. The same way we should try to find
out what kinds of quantum mechanical systems are mutually intersimulatable,
and try to find a specific class, or a character of that class which will
simulate everything. What, in other words, is the universal quantum simulator?
(assuming this discretization of space and time). If you had discrete
quantum systems, what other discrete quantum systems are exact imitators
of it, and is there a class against which everything can be matched? I believe
it's rather simple to answer that question and to find the class, but I just
haven't done it.
Suppose that we try the following guess: that every finite quantum
mechanical system can be described exactly, imitated exactly, by supposing
that we have another system such that at each point in space-time this
system has only two possible base states. Either that point is occupied, or
unoccupied--those are the two states. The mathematics of the quantum
mechanical operators associated with that point would be very simple.

There would be an operator a which annihilates if the point is occupied
--it changes it to unoccupied. There is a conjugate operator a* which does
the opposite: if it's unoccupied, it occupies it. There's another operator n
called the number to ask, Is something there? The little matrices tell you
what they do. If it's there, n gets a one and leaves it alone, if it's not there,
nothing happens. That's mathematically equivalent to the product of the
other two, as a matter of fact. And then there's the identity, ~, which we
always have to put in there to complete our mathematics--it doesn't do a
damn thing!
By the way, on the right-hand side of the above formulas the same
operators are written in terms of matrices that most physicists find more
convenient, because they are Hermitian, and that seems to make it easier for
them. They have invented another set of matrices, the Pauli o matrices:
1°) o:(0 01) o_(0 i -i)0
And these are called spin--spin one-half--so sometimes people say you're
talking about a spin-one-half lattice.
The question is, if we wrote a Hamiltonian which involved only these
operators, locally coupled to corresponding operators on the other space-time
points, could we imitate every quantum mechanical system which is discrete
and has a finite number of degrees of freedom? I know, almost certainly,
that we could do that for any quantum mechanical system which involves
Bose particles. I'm not sure whether Fermi particles could be described by
such a system. So I leave that open. Well, that's an example of what I meant
by a general quantum mechanical simulator. I'm not sure that it's sufficient,
because I'm not sure that it takes care of Fermi particles.
5. CAN QUANTUM SYSTEMS BE PROBABILISTICALLY
SIMULATED BY A CLASSICAL COMPUTER?
Now the next question that I would like to bring up is, of course, the
interesting one, i.e., Can a quantum system be probabilisticaUy simulated by
a classical (probabilistic, I'd assume) universal computer? In other words, a
computer which will give the same probabilities as the quantum system
does. If you take the computer to be the classical kind I've described so far,
(not the quantum kind described in the last section) and there're no changes
in any laws, and there's no hocus-pocus, the answer is certainly, No! This is
called the hidden-variable problem: it is impossible to represent the results
of quantum mechanics with a classical universal device. To learn a little bit
about it, I say let us try to put the quantum equations in a form as close as
Simulating Physics with Computers 477
possible to classical equations so that we can see what the difficulty is and
what happens. Well, first of all we can't simulate ~k in the normal way. As
I've explained already, there're too many variables. Our only hope is that
we're going to simulate probabilities, that we're going to have our computer
do things with the same probability as we observe in nature, as calculated
by the quantum mechanical system. Can you make a cellular automaton, or
something, imitate with the same probability what nature does, where I'm
going to suppose that quantum mechanics is correct, or at least after I
discretize space and time it's correct, and see if I can do it. I must point out
that you must directly generate the probabilities, the results, with the correct
quantum probability. Directly, because we have no way to store all the
numbers, we have to just imitate the phenomenon directly.
It turns out then that another thing, rather than the wave function, a
thing called the density matrix, is much more useful for this. It's not so
useful as far as the mathematical equations are concerned, since it's more
complicated than the equations for ~b, but I'm not going to worry about
mathematical complications, or which is the easiest way to calculate, because
with computers we don't have to be so careful to do it the very easiest
way. And so with a slight increase in the complexity of the equations (and
not very much increase) I turn to the density matrix, which for a single
particle of coordinate x in a pure state of wave function q~(x) is
p(x, x')=
This has a special property that is a function of two coordinates x, x'. The
presence of two quantities x and x' associated with each coordinate is
analogous to the fact that in classical mechanics you have to have two
variables to describe the state, x and ~. States are described by a second-order
device, with two informations ("position" and "velocity"). So we have to
have two pieces of information associated with a particle, analogous to the
classical situation, in order to describe configurations. (I've written the
density matrix for one particle, but of course there's the analogous thing for
R particles, a function of 2R variables).
This quantity has many of the mathematical properties of a probability.
For example if a state ~(x) is not certain but is ~k~ with the probability p~
then the density matrix is the appropriate weighted sum of the matrix for
each state a:
p(x, x,)=
A quantity which has properties even more similar to classical probabilities
is the Wigner function, a simple reexpression of the density matrix; for a
478 Feynman
single particle
W(x,p)=fo(x+Y,x-Y)eiPYdy
We shall be emphasizing their similarity and shall call it "probability" in
quotes instead of Wigner function. Watch these quotes carefully, when they
are absent we mean the real probability. If "probability" had all the
mathematical properties of a probability we could remove the quotes and
simulate it. W(x, p) is the "probability" that the particle has position x and
momentum p (per dx and dp). What properties does it have that are
analogous to an ordinary probability?
It has the property that if there are many variables and you want to
know the "probabilities" associated with a finite region, you simply disregard
the other variables (by integration). Furthermore the probability of
finding a particle at x is fW(x,p)dp. If you can interpret W as a
probability of finding x and p, this would be an expected equation. Likewise
the probability of p would be expected to be fW(x, p)dx. These two
equations are correct, and therefore you would hope that maybe W(x, p ) is
the probability of finding x and p. And the question then is can we make a
device which simulates this W? Because then it would work fine.
Since the quantum systems I noted were best represented by spin
one-half (occupied versus unoccupied or spin one-half is the same thing), I
tried to do the same thing for spin one-half objects, and it's rather easy to
do. Although before one object only had two states, occupied and unoccupied,
the full description--in order to develop things as a function of time
--requires twice as many variables, which mean two slots at each point
which are occupied or unoccupied (denoted by + and - in what follows),
analogous to the x and 2, or the x and p. So you can find four numbers,
four "probabilities" (f+ +, f+ _, f_+, f__ ) which act just like, and I have
to explain why they're not exactly like, but they act just like, probabilities to
find things in the state in which both symbols are up, one's up and one's
down, and so on. For example, the sum f+ + + f+_ + f_ + + f__ of the
four "probabilities" is 1. You'll remember that one object now is going to
have two indices, two plus/minus indices, or two ones and zeros at each
point, although the quantum system had only one. For example, if you
would like to know whether the first index is positive, the probability of that
would be
Prob(first index is + ) = f+ + + f+ _ [spin z up]
i.e., you don't care about the second index. The probability that the first
index is negative is
Prob(first index is -) = f_ + + f_ _, [spin z down]
Simulating Physics with Computers 479
These two formulas are exactly correct in quantum mechanics. You see I'm
hedging on whether or not "probability" f can really be a probability
without quotes. But when I write probability without quotes on the left-hand
side I'm not hedging; that really is the quantum mechanical probability. It's
interpreted perfectly fine here. Likewise the probability that the second
index is positive can be obtained by finding
Prob(second index is +) =/+ + + f_ + [spin x up]
and likewise
Prob(second index is --) = f+ _ + f_ _ [spin x down]
You could also ask other questions about the system. You might like to
know, What is the probability that both indices are positive? You'll get in
trouble. But you could ask other questions that you won't get in trouble
with, and that get correct physical answers. You can ask, for example, what
is the probability that the two indices are the same? That would be
Prob(match) = f+ + + f_ _ [spin y up]
Or the probability that there's no match between the indices, that they're
different,
Prob(no match) = f+ _ + f_ + [spin y down]
All perfectly all right. All these probabilities are correct and make sense,
and have a precise meaning in the spin model, shown in the square brackets
above. There are other "probability" combinations, other linear combinations
of these f's which also make physically sensible probabilities, but I
won't go into those now. There are other linear combinations that you can
ask questions about, but you don't seem to be able to ask questions about
an individual f.
6. NEGATIVE PROBABILITIES
Now, for many interacting spins on a lattice we can give a "probability"
(the quotes remind us that there is still a question about whether it's a
probability) for correlated possibilities:
......
480 Feynanan
Next, if I look for the quantum mechanical equation which tells me what the
changes of F are with time, they are exactly of the form that I wrote above
for the classical theory:
(s'}
but now we have F instead of P. The M(sils},@.. ) would appear to be
interpreted as the "probability" per unit time, or per time jump, that the
state at i turns into s i when the neighbors are in configuration s'. If you can
invent a probability M like that, you write the equations for it according to
normal logic, those are the correct equations, the real, correct, quant~am
mechanical equations for this F, and therefore you'd say, Okay, so I can
imitate it with a probabilistic computer!
There's only one thing wrong. These equations unfortunately cannot be
so interpreted on the basis of the so-called "probability", or this probabLlistic
computer can't simulate them, because the F is not necessarily positive.
Sometimes it's negative! The M, the "probability" (so-called) of mowing
from one condition to another is itself not positive; if I had gone all the ,,way
back to the f for a single object, it again is not necessarily positive.
An example of possibilities here are
f++ =0.6 f+_ = -0.1 f_+ =0.3 f__ =0.2
The sum f+ + + f+ _ is 0.5, that's 50% chance of finding the first index
positive. The probability of finding the first index negative is the slam
f_ + + f_ + which is also 50%. The probability of finding the second index
positive is the sum f+ + + f_+ which is nine tenths, the probability of
finding it negative is f÷_ + f__ which is one-tenth, perfectly alright, it's
either plus or minus. The probability that they match is eight-tenths, the
probability that they mismatch is plus two-tenths; every physical probability
comes out positive. But the original f's are not positive, and therein lies
the great difficulty. The only difference between a probabilistic classical
world and the equations of the quantum world is that somehow or other it
appears as if the probabilities would have to go negative, and that we do not
know, as far as I know, how to simulate. Okay, that's the fundameratal
problem. I don't know the answer to it, but I wanted to explain that if I try
my best to make the equations look as near as possible to what would be
imitable by a classical probabilistic computer, I get into trouble.

7. POLARIZATION OF PHOTONS--TWO-STATES SYSTEMS
I would like to show you why such minus signs cannot be avoided, or
at least that you have some sort of difficulty. You probably have all heard
this example of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox, but I will explain this
little example of a physical experiment which can be done, and which has
been done, which does give the answers quantum theory predicts, and the
answers are really right, there's no mistake, if you do the experiment, it
actually comes out. And I'm going to use the example of polarizations of
photons, which is an example of a two-state system. When a photon comes,
you can say it's either x polarized or y polarized. You can find that out by
putting in a piece of calcite, and the photon goes through the calcite either
out in one direction, or out in another--actually slightly separated, and
then you put in some mirrors, that's not important. You get two beams, two
places out, where the photon can go. (See Figure 2.)
If you put a polarized photon in, then it will go to one beam called the
ordinary ray, or another, the extraordinary one. If you put detectors there
you find that each photon that you put in, it either comes out in one or the
other 100% of the time, and not half and half. You either find a photon in
one or the other. The probability of finding it in the ordinary ray plus the
probability of finding it in the extraordinary ray is always 1--you have to
have that rule. That works. And further, it's never found at both detectors.
(If you might have put two photons in, you could get that, but you cut the
intensity down--it's a technical thing, you don't find them in both detectors.)

Now the next experiment: Separation into 4 polarized beams (see
Figure 3). You put two calcites in a row so that their axes have a relative
angle ~, I happen to have drawn the second calcite in two positions, but it
doesn't make a difference if you use the same piece or not, as you care. Take
the ordinary ray from one and put it through another piece of calcite and
look at its ordinary ray, which I'll call the ordinary-ordinary (O-O) ray, or
look at its extraordinary ray, I have the ordinary-extraordinary (O- E) ray.
And then the extraordinary ray from the first one comes out as the E-O
ray, and then there's an E-E ray, alright. Now you can ask what happens.
Fig. 2.
482 Feynman
E 4~pr.~ ~
Fig. 3.
You'll find the following. When a photon comes in, you always find that only
one of the four counters goes off.
If the photon is O from the first calcite, then the second calcite gives
O-O with probability cos2 ep or O-E with the complementary probability
1-cosl~ = sin z ~. Likewise an E photon gives a E-O with the probability
sin 2 ~ or an E-E with the probability cos 2 ~.
8. TWO-PHOTON CORRELATION EXPERIMENT
Let us turn now to the two photon correlation experiment (see
Figure 4).
What can happen is that an atom emits two photons in opposite
direction (e.g., the 3s--,2p-, ls transition in the H atom). They are observed
simultaneously (say, by you and by me) through two calcites set at q~l
and ~2 to the vertical. Quantum theory and experiment agree that the
probability Poo that both of us detect an ordinary photon is
Poo = k cos2 ('h - q'l)
The probability tee that we both observe an extraordinary ray is the same
eee = ½cos ~ (~'2 - ~,)
The probability Poe that I find O and you find E is
PoE = ½sin 2 (~2 - ~, )
oE Jo
Fig. 4.
Simulating Physics with Computers 483
and finally the probability Peo that I measure E and you measure O is
eEo = ½sin 2 -
Notice that you can always predict, from your own measurement, what I
shall get, O or E. For any axis ~ that I chose, just set your axis ~2 to ff~,
then
Poe = PEo = 0
and I must get whatever you get.
Let us see now how it would have to be for a local probabilistic
computer. Photon 1 must be in some condition a with the probabilityf~(ff~),
that determines it to go through as an ordinary ray [the probability it would
pass as E is 1- f~(e?l) ]. Likewise photon 2 will be in a condition fl with
probability ga(~2). If p~a is the conjoint probability to find the condition
pair a, r, the probability Poo that both of us observe O rays is
eoo( , = Ep a = l
,,B ,~B
likewise
PoE(~,,¢2) = ~p,a(1-f,(4,,))ga(~2) etc.
The conditions a determine how the photons go. There's some kind of
correlation of the conditions. Such a formula cannot reproduce the quantum
results above for any p~a, f~(~l), ga(q~2) if they are real probabilities--that
is all positive, although it is easy if they are "probabilities"--negative for
some conditions or angles. We now analyze why that is so.
I don't know what kinds of conditions they are, but for any condition
the probability f~(~) of its being extraordinary or ordinary in any direction
must be either one or zero. Otherwise you couldn't predict it on the other
side. You would be unable to predict with certainty what I was going to get,
unless, every time the photon comes here, which way it's going to go is
absolutely determined. Therefore, whatever condition the photon is in, there
is some hidden inside variable that's going to determine whether it's going
to be ordinary or extraordinary. This determination is done deterministically,
not probabilistically; otherwise we can't explain the fact that you
could predict what I was going to get exactly. So let us suppose that
something like this happens. Suppose we discuss results just for angles
which are multiples of 30 ° .
484 Feynrnan
On each diagram (Figure 5) are the angles 0 °, 30 °, 60 °, 90 °, 120 °, and
150 °. A particle comes out to me, and it's in some sort of state, so what it's
going to give for 0 °, for 30 °, etc. are all predicted--determined--by the
state. Let us say that in a particular state that is set up the prediction for 0 °
is that it'll be extraordinary (black dot), for 30 ° it's also extraordinary, for
60 ° it's ordinary (white dot), and so on (Figure 5a). By the way, the
outcomes are complements of each other at fight angles, because, remember,
it's always either extraordinary or ordinary; so if you turn 90 ° , what used to
be an ordinary ray becomes the extraordinary ray. Therefore, whatever
condition it's in, it has some predictive pattern in which you either have a
prediction of ordinary or of extraordinary--three and three--because at
right angles they're not the same color. Likewise the particle that comes to
you when they're separated must have the same pattern because you can
determine what I'm going to get by measuring yours. Whatever circumstances
come out, the patterns must be the same. So, if I want to know, Am
I going to get white at 60°? You just measure at 60 °, and you'll find white,
and therefore you'll predict white, or ordinary, for me. Now each time we
do the experiment the pattern may not be the same. Every time we make a
pair of photons, repeating this experiment again and again, it doesn't have
to be the same as Figure 5a. Let's assume that the next time the experiment
my photon will be O or E for each angle as in Figure 5c. Then your pattern
looks like Figure 5d. But whatever it is, your pattern has to be my pattern
exactly--otherwise you couldn't predict what I was going to get exactly by
measuring the corresponding angle. And so on. Each time we do the
experiment, we get different patterns; and it's easy: there are just six dots
and three of them are white, and you chase them around different way--everything
can happen. If we measure at the same angle, we always find that
with this kind of arrangement we would get the same result.
Now suppose we measure at @z - @, = 30°, and ask, With what probability
do we get the same result? Let's first try this example here (Figure
5a,5b). With what probability would we get the same result, that they're
90"
x.7

both white, or they're both black? The thing comes out like this: suppose I
say, After they come out, I'm going to choose a direction at random, I tell
you to measure 30 ° to the right of that direction. Then whatever I get, you
would get something different if the neighbors were different. (We would
get the same if the neighbors were the same.) What is the chance that you
get the same result as me? The chance is the number of times that the
neighbor is the same color. If you'll think a minute, you'll find that two
thirds of the time, in the case of Figure 5a, it's the same color. The worst
case would be black/white/black/white/black/white, and there the probability
of a match would be zero (Figure 5c, d). If you look at all eight
possible distinct cases, you'll find that the biggest possible answer is
two-thirds. You cannot arrange, in a classical kind of method like this, that
the probability of agreement at 30 ° will be bigger than two-thirds. But the
quantum mechanical formula predicts cos/30 ° (or 3/4)--and experiments
agree with this--and therein lies the difficulty.
That's all. That's the difficulty. That's why quantum mechanics can't
seem to be imitable by a local classical computer.
I've entertained myself always by squeezing the difficulty of quantum
mechanics into a smaller and smaller place, so as to get more and more
worried about this particular item. It seems to be almost ridiculous that you
can squeeze it to a numerical question that one thing is bigger than another.
But there you are--it is bigger than any logical argument can produce, if
you have this kind of logic. Now, we say "this kind of logic;" what other
possibilities are there? Perhaps there may be no possibilities, but perhaps
there are. Its interesting to try to discuss the possibilities. I mentioned
something about the possibility of time--of things being affected not just
by the past, but also by the future, and therefore that our probabilities are
in some sense "illusory." We only have the information from the past, and
we try to predict the next step, but in reality it depends upon the near future
which we can't get at, or something like that. A very interesting question is
the origin of the probabilities in quantum mechanics. Another way of
puttings things is this: we have an illusion that we can do any experiment
that we want. We all, however, come from the same universe, have evolved
with it, and don't really have any "real" freedom. For we obey certain laws
and have come from a certain past. Is it somehow that we are correlated to
the experiments that we do, so that the apparent probabilities don't look
like they ought to look if you assume that they are random. There are all
kinds of questions like this, and what I'm trying to do is to get you people
who think about computer-simulation possibilities to pay a great deal of
attention to this, to digest as well as possible the real answers of quantum
mechanics, and see if you can't invent a different point of view than the
physicists have had to invent to describe this. In fact the physicists have no
486 Feynman
good point of view. Somebody mumbled something about a many-world
picture, and that many-world picture says that the wave function ~ is what's
real, and damn the torpedos if there are so many variables, N R. All these
different worlds and every arrangement of configurations are all there just
like our arrangement of configurations, we just happen to be sitting in this
one. It's possible, but I'm not very happy with it.
So, I would like to see if there's some other way out, and I want to
emphasize, or bring the question here, because the discovery of computers
and the thinking about computers has turned out to be extremely useful in
many branches of human reasoning. For instance, we never really understood
how lousy our understanding of languages was, the theory of grammar
and all that stuff, until we tried to make a computer which would be
able to understand language. We tried to learn a great deal about psychology
by trying to understand how computers work. There are interesting
philosophical questions about reasoning, and relationship, observation, and
measurement and so on, which computers have stimulated us to think about
anew, with new types of thinking. And all I was doing was hoping that the
computer-type of thinking would give us some new ideas, if any are really
needed. I don't know, maybe physics is absolutely OK the way it is. The
program that Fredkin is always pushing, about trying to find a computer
simulation of physics, seem to me to be an excellent program to follow out.
He and I have had wonderful, intense, and interminable arguments, and rny
argument is always that the real use of it would be with quantum mechanics,
and therefore full attention and acceptance of the quantum mechanical
phenomena--the challenge of explaining quantum mechanical phenomena
--has to be put into the argument, and therefore these phenomena have to
be understood very well in analyzing the situation. And I'm not happy with
all the analyses that go with just the classical theory, because nature isn't
classical, dammit, and if you want to make a simulation of nature, you'd
better make it quantum mechanical, and by golly it's a wonderful problem,
because it doesn't look so easy. Thank you.
9. DISCUSSION
Question: Just to interpret, you spoke first of the probability of A given
B, versus the probability of A and B jointly--that's the probability of one
observer seeing the result, assigning a probability to the other; and then you
brought up the paradox of the quantum mechanical result being 3/4, and
this being 2/3. Are those really the same probabilities? Isn't one a joint
probability, and the other a conditional one?
Answer: No, they are the same. Poo is the joint probability that both you
and I observe an ordinary ray, and PeE is the joint probability for two
Simulating Physics with Computers 487
extraordinary rays. The probability that our observations match is
Pot + PEE = COS2 30° = 3/4
Question: Does it in some sense depend upon an assumption as to how
much information is accessible from the photon, or from the particle? And
second, to take your question of prediction, your comment about predicting,
is in some sense reminiscent of the philosophical question, Is there any
meaning to the question of whether there is free will or predestination?
namely, the correlation between the observer and the experiment, and the
question there is, Is it possible to construct a test in which the prediction
could be reported to the observer, or instead, has the ability to represent
information already been used up? And I suspect that you may have already
used up all the information so that prediction lies outside the range of the
theory.
Answer: All these things I don't understand; deep questions, profound
questions. However physicists have a kind of a dopy way of avoiding all of
these things. They simply say, now look, friend, you take a pair of counters
and you put them on the side of your calcite and you count how many times
you get this stuff, and it comes out 75% of the time. Then you go and you
say, Now can I imitate that with a device which is going to produce the
same results, and which will operate locally, and you try to invent some
kind of way of doing that, and if you do it in the ordinary way of thinking,
you find that you can't get there with the same probability. Therefore some
new kind of thinking is necessary, but physicists, being kind of dull minded,
only look at nature, and don't know how to think in these new ways.
Question: At the beginning of your talk, you talked about discretizing
various things in order to go about doing a real computation of physics.
And yet it seems to me that there are some differences between things like
space and time, and probability that might exist at some place, or energy, or
some field value. Do you see any reason to distinguish between quantization
or discretizing of space and time, versus discretizing any of the specific
parameters or values that might exist?
Answer: I would like to make a few comments. You said quantizing or
discretizing. That's very dangerous. Quantum theory and quantizing is a
very specific type of theory. Discretizing is the right word. Quantizing is a
different kind of mathematics. If we talk about discretizing.., of course I
pointed out that we're going to have to change the laws of physics. Because
the laws of physics as written now have, in the classical limit, a continuous
variable everywhere, space and time. If, for example, in your theory you
were going to have an electric field, then the electric field could not have (if
it's going to be imitable, computable by a finite number of elements) an
488 Feynnnan
infinite number of possible values, it'd have to be digitized. You might be
able to get away with a theory by redescribing things without an electric
field, but supposing for a moment that you've discovered that you can't do
that and you want to describe it with an electric field, then you would have
to say that, for example, when fields are smaller than a certain amount, they
aren't there at all, or something. And those are very interesting problems,
but unfortunately they're not good problems for classical physics because if
you take the example of a star a hundred light years away, and it makes a
wave which comes to us, and it gets weaker, and weaker, and weaker, and
weaker, the electric field's going down, down, down, how low can nve
measure? You put a counter out there and you find "clunk," and nothing
happens for a while, "clunk," and nothing happens for a while. It's riot
discretized at all, you never can measure such a tiny field, you don't find a
tiny field, you don't have to imitate such a tiny field, because the world that
you're trying to imitate, the physical world, is not the classical world, and it
behaves differently. So the particular example of discretizing the electric
field, is a problem which I would not see, as a physicist, as fundamentally
difficult, because it will just mean that your field has gotten so small that I
had better be using quantum mechanics anyway, and so you've got the
wrong equations, and so you did the wrong problem! That's how I would
answer that. Because you see, if you would imagine that the electric field is
coming out of some 'ones' or something, the lowest you could get would be
a full one, but that's what we see, you get a full photon. All these things
suggest that it's really true, somehow, that the physical world is representable
in a discretized way, because every time you get into a bind like this,
you discover that the experiment does just what's necessary to escape the
trouble that would come if the electric field went to zero, or you'd never be
able to see a star beyond a certain distance, because the field would have
gotten below the number of digits that your world can carry.
