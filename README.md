## Introduction to Interactive Programming Part 1
### [Rice University and Coursera Spring 2017](https://www.coursera.org/learn/interactive-python-1/home/welcome)

#### This course uses [Codeskulptor](http://www.codeskulptor.org/), which is a browser-based Python interpreter that implements a subset of Python 2.
#### Codeskulptor documentation can be found [here](http://www.codeskulptor.org/docs.html#tabs-Python).  

#### [Skulpt](https://github.com/skulpt/skulpt) is a Javascript implementation of the Python programming language.

#### Codeskulptor won't load demos or files linked from the class in Chrome (I may have enabled security precautions that are the reason), but Firefox seems to work just fine.  

I am in [week 2](https://www.coursera.org/learn/interactive-python-1/home/week/2).
